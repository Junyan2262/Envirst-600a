            The project site is the Community’s Reservation, located in Redwood
            County, Minnesota (the Site), along the southern bank of the
            Minnesota River south of the city of Morton (the City). The
            reservation is 1,743 acres in size. Figure 1-1 shows the Site. The
            Community has a number of enterprises, including the Jackpot
            Junction Casino Hotel (the Casino). The Casino complex also houses
            the Dacotah Exposition Center and Outdoor Amphitheater, and the
            Lower Sioux Lodge.

        <div class="title">Lower Sioux Indian Tribe Advantages</div>

        <p>
          ● The Lower Sioux Indian Tribe has many advantages that allowed them
          to pursue this project
        </p>
        <p>● Aid and funding of the government</p>
        <p>
          ● Businesses include: Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel, The Dacotah
          Exposition Center and Outdoor Amphitheater, and the Lower Sioux Lodge
        </p>
        <p>● Not all Tribes have these same opportunities</p>
        <p>
          ● Tribes find wind power development nearly impossible if they lack
          any particular advantages—no participation in CERT (Council of Energy
          Resource Tribes), no fossil fuel economy, no federal grants for wind
          power development, etc.

        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          ● Aim to provide clean, renewable energy to the Lower Sioux
          reservation through the installation of a 1.5 MW wind turbine and an
          accompanying solar field.
        </p>
        <p>● Sell surplus energy to nearby utility grids.</p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <p>● Decrease dependency on non-renewable energy.</p>
        <p>● Create employment and economic opportunities.</p>
