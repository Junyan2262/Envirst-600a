            This analysis is done to explore different tax incentives and the
            impact they have on the year this project will pay back the costs it
            incurred over its 20 year life-time.

        <h3>Envirnmental Quality</h3>

        <p>
          ● Indigenous communities have been deeply affected by extractive
          industries such as fossil fuel and uranium mining.
        </p>
        <p>
          ● When Tribal Nations pursue fossil fuel extraction as an economic
          opportunity, they bear the brunt of health and environmental impacts
          from these industries
        </p>
        <p>
          ● Shifting away from fossil fuels can also help protect other economic
          industries that support Tribal communities
        </p>
        <p>
          ● The Red Lake Nation is pursuing renewable energy after they found
          high amounts of mercury in its walleye population, which came from the
          burning of fossil fuels. The Red Lake fisheries is the Tribe’s oldest
          business, so transitioning to renewable energy can help protect it .
        </p>
        <h3>Cultural Considerations</h3>

        <p>
          ● From earliest times, the Indigenous people of North America have
          regarded not only the land, but also water, minerals, plants, animals,
          and indeed the air we breathe as being resources that are available
          for all to use, forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          ● Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy can help to protect
          these resources for future generations
        </p>
        <p>
          ● Including communities in the decision-making and planning process
          for implementing renewable energy on tribal lands to make sure their
          values are respected
        </p>
        <h3>Social and Community Dynamics</h3>

        <p>● Provide new jobs to Native Americans</p>
        <p>● Community empowerment and engagement</p>
        <p>
          ● Implementing renewable energy systems themselves can help increase a
          Tribe’s sovereignty
        </p>
        <h3>Tech/infrastructure challenges</h3>

        <p>
          ● The most significant barriers to the development of renewable energy
          on Tribal lands are a lack of financing, infrastructure, training in
          renewable energy careers, resources to access that training, and
          inadequately supported Tribal leadership and staff
        </p>
        <p>
          ● Small-scale projects are not economically feasible as an alternative
          to grid connection, large-scale projects require significant outside
          capital, and high infrastructure costs are necessary to reach remote
          locations
