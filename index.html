        <h2>Objective of Research</h2>
        <p>
          Wind energy projects on Native lands can strengthen Native energy
          sovereignty and independence by giving tribes control over their own
          energy resources and reducing dependence on outside suppliers. These
          projects can create jobs, generate revenue, and allow tribes to
          reinvest in their communities and support areas such as education and
          health care. By forgoing fossil fuels, wind energy reduces
          environmental harm. This self-reliance gives tribes the ability to
          make decisions that reflect their priorities and build long-term
          economic resilience. We performed cost benefit analysis of
          implementing wind energy on Native lands. This can be used to help
          Native people get support to implement wind energy. We looked
          specifically at a case study of a tribe that implemented a wind energy
          project and evaluate this project.
